# Violette

Violette is a simple functional programming language. It is a work in progress!

current features include:

- everything is an expression
- a parenthesized expression is just a block with one expression: `{\x -> x}`
- first-class functions

## Toplevel

To start the toplevel (REPL), run:

```sh
dune exec violette toplevel
```
